The TimVideos project has a
[dedicated issue tracker](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues)
which contains tasks (both small and large) which are suitable for
contributing as part of organised programs like;

 * [Google Summer of Code students](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/),
 * University Honors Projects, or
 * University Industry Placement/Intern programs.

We are very happy to work with students who wish to contribute to the TimVideos
project as part of their university course work (and happy to fill out the
required paper work).

**Anyone** is welcome to start working on these tasks if they are interested,
the tasks are just more structured to better suit more structured
contributions.
