This repository is only used for the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues). 

The issue tracker contains a bunch of projects (from small to large) which are
great ways to get started on the TimVideos project. It is a great place to
start for Google Summer of Code students.

Another place to look for good bugs to get started with is the global
[TimVideos issue tracker](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Atimvideos).

For more information about the TimVideos project and contributing the TimVideos
developer website can be found at http://code.timvideos.us
