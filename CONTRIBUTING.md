The issue tracker contains a bunch of well formed projects (both small and
large) which are great ways to get started contributing to the 
[TimVideos project](https://code.timvideos.us/) if you have a block of time you
can allocated (such as participating in a program like 
[Google Summer of Code students](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/) or
part of a University's Honors Project or Industry Placement/Intern program.
