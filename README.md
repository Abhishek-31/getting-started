## Contributing via University or other programs

The TimVideos project has a
[dedicated issue tracker](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues)
which contains tasks (both small and large) which are suitable for
contributing as part of organised programs like;

 * [Google Summer of Code students](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/),
 * University Honors Projects, or
 * University Industry Placement/Intern programs.

We are very happy to work with students who wish to contribute to the TimVideos
project as part of their university course work (and happy to fill out the
required paper work).

## Smaller Bugs

If you are looking for smaller bugs to get started with, try the global
[TimVideos issue tracker](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Atimvideos)
and look for bugs marked with the <span class="good-first-bug">Good First
Bug</a> label.

### Using Labels to Filter

![Issue Filter](/img/issue-filter.png)

### Understanding Labels

All tasks in the tracker should have labels assigned to them. The labels have
specific meanings which are listed here;

#### `Difficulty` Label

The difficulty label indicates how much knowledge or ability is needed in the
skills labels attached.

`Easy` tasks are suitable for people who might **not** have the skill(s) /
language(s) listed but are willing to learn them. `Easy` tasks should be
comprehensively specified.

`Medium` tasks are suitable for people who already have some experience with
the skill(s) / language(s) and reasonable confident with them. `Medium` tasks
might require some research or independent development.

`Challenging` tasks are suitable for people who have extensive experience with
the skill(s) / language(s) and are confident in their ability with them. These
tasks might also be underspecified and require a lot of independent research.

While tasks at any level can be completed by anyone, the levels generally map
the following experience levels,

 * `Easy` tasks are ideally suited to students who are currently starting out
   at University or wishing to learn **new** skills.
 * `Medium` tasks are better suited to students who are at the end of their
    undergraduate degrees.
 * `Challenging` tasks are better suited to people who are doing post graduate
   work.
